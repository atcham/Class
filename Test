The Cat Maiden - An Aesop's Fable

Moral of Aesops Fable: Nature will out
 

The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change its nature. 

Jupiter said "Yes," but Venus said "No." So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife.

The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast. 

"See," said Jupiter, to Venus, "how becomingly she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat? Surely her nature is changed?"

"Wait a minute," replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the room.

No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse. 

"Ah, you see," said Venus, "Nature will out"

Sour Grapes - An Aesop's Fable

Moral of Aesops Fable: It is easy to hate what you cannot have


A very hungry fox walked into a vineyard where there was an ample supply of luscious looking grapes. 

Grapes had never looked so good, and the fox was famished. 

However, the grapes hung higher than the fox could reach. 

He jumped and stretched and hopped and reached and jumped some more trying to get those yummy grapes, but to no avail. 

No matter what he tried, he could not reach the grapes. 

He wore himself out jumping and jumping to get the grapes.

"Those grapes surely must be sour," he said as he walked away, 

"I wouldn't eat them if they were served to me on a silver platter."
